A regression analysis was conducted where regression algorithms were explored and utilized with libraries such as Pandas, Seaborn, whereas some models were built using Scikit-Learn, and a feed forward neural network was built using Keras API within TensorFlow. The dataset that was used was containing information about energy efficiency and the heating load/cooling load, where the main aim was to evaluate models and also integrate a neural network to determine which model that performed best.
